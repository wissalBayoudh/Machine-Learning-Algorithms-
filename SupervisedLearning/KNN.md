# What is K-NN ?
K-NN is a **non-parametric and lazy learning algorithm**. Non-parametric means there is no assumption for underlying data distribution i.e. the model structure determined from the dataset.
/t It is called Lazy algorithm because it does not need any training data points for model generation. All training data is used in the testing phase which makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier.
K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) is a simple algorithm that stores all the available cases and classifies the new data or case based on a similarity measure.
