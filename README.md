# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
In this Curriculum you’ll find the Types of Machine Learning Algorithms You Should Know along with their code from scratch and examples with python or R. But before we get there let’s begin with describing each type: 

## Types of machine learning Algorithms
There some variations of how to define the types of Machine Learning Algorithms but commonly they can be divided into categories according to their purpose and the main categories are the following:

-	Supervised learning
-	Unsupervised Learning
-	Semi-supervised Learning
-	Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning 
I like to think of supervised learning with the concept of function approximation, where basically we train an algorithm and in the end of the process we pick the function that best describes the input data the one that for a given, X makes the best estimation of y(X->y).
### List of Common Algorithms
-	Nearest Neighbor
-	Naive Bayes
-	Decision Trees
-	Linear Regression
-	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-	Neural Networks
## Unsupervised Learning
The computer is trained with unlabeled data.
### List of Common Algorithms
- k-means clustering
- Association Rules
 
## Reinforcement Learning
method aims at using observations gathered from the interaction with the environment to take actions that would maximize the reward or minimize the risk. Reinforcement learning algorithm (called the agent) continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion. In the process, the agent learns from its experiences of the environment until it explores the full range of possible states.
### List of Common Algorithms
- Q-Learning
- Temporal Difference (TD)
- Deep Adversarial Networks
